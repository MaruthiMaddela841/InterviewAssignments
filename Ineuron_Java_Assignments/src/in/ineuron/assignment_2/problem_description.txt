Write a Java program to invoke parent class constructor from a child class. Create
Child class object and parent class constructor must be invoked. Demonstrate by
writing a program. Also explain key points about Constructor.

Key Points about Constructors:

Purpose:
Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects.
They share the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

Types of Constructors:
Default Constructor: Provided by the compiler if no constructor is defined.
Parameterized Constructor: Takes arguments to initialize an object with specific values.

Calling Parent Constructor:
Use super() to explicitly call the parent class constructor.
If super() is not specified, the default or no-argument constructor of the parent class is invoked implicitly.

Overloading:
Constructors can be overloaded to allow multiple ways of object initialization.

Inheritance:
Child class constructors automatically invoke the parent class constructor (default or specified with super()).
